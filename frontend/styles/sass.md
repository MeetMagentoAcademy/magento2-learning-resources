# SASS lang as a replacment of LESS

LESS for various resons and implementataion quality for us wasn't a good choice. So we decided to create own tools and theme for Magento 2 and replace everything, because we can.

```
Installs:  16 456
Stars:     177
Watchers:  35
Forks:     52
```

And this brings us to cooperation with Magento Core team.
