# Themes overview

A theme is a component of Magento application which provides a consistent look and feel using a combination of custom templates, layouts, styles or images.

Themes are designed to override or customize view layer resources, provided initially by modules or libraries.

Out-of-the-box Magento application provides two design themes:
- Luma, as a demonstration theme
- Blank as a basis for custom theme creation

We strongly recommend not to change the default Luma and Blank theme files, because if you do edit the default files, your changes can be overwritten by the new version of the default files during upgrades.

Your new theme can be a standalone new theme, or it can inherit from the default or any other existing one. The theme inheritance concept implemented in the Magento system allows you to change only certain theme files, and inherit other required files from a parent theme.
